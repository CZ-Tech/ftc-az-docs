{% hint style="danger" %}
This project is in the early testing phase and is for reference only.

If the code is used in actual competitions, we cannot guarantee that it will run reliably, nor can we take any responsibility for the competition results.
{% endhint %}

## Why did we write this document?
While participating in FTC activities, **Team#19656 Absolute Zero** is always committed to return to the great content from FTC community. However, we are concerned that other teams may have difficulties to use the FTC SDK. Thus, this document comes out.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please make sure you have a basic knowledge of the FTC SDK before reading the code. All of our code is based on [FtcRobotController](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/).
{% endhint %}

## How to read this document
Please refer to the [installation](installation.md) guide to download the code and synchronize Gradle, and make sure that you have read the code at first.

Then, you can read the rest of the document that explains each part of the code and make your own changes based on the source code.

**Note: Make sure you have written your own scoring method into the code.**

## Recommendations and improvements
