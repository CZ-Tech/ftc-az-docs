This project is in the early testing phase and is for reference only.

If using our code in an actual contest, we cannot guarantee that the code will run completely reliably, nor can we take any responsibility for the outcome of the contest.

## Why did we write this document?
While participating in FTC activities,**Team#19656 Absolute Zero** is always committed to giving back to the great content from FTC community.However, we are concerned that other teams using the code may have a difficult time reading it or may misunderstand it. To address this concern, we wrote this document to ilustrate our code.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please make sure you have a basic knowledge of the FTC SDK before reading the code. All of our code is based on FTC RobotController.
{% endhint %}

## How to read this document

Then, you can read the rest of the document that explains each part of the code and make your own changes based on the source code.

**Note: Make sure you have written your own scoring method into the code.**

Finally, use your own code in the contest!
