### Git

Using the Git tool, use the git command on the command line to download the code:

It is recommended to put the FtcRobotController folder in the root directory of the disk, not in a folder with non-standard ASCII codes in the path to avoid problems.


## Install and Use

It is recommended to use Android Studio as an editor.


Open your program editor and import the FtcRobotController folder. 

**Notes: do not import the inner FtcRobotController.**

You will see the structure of that folder presented in the list to the left of your program editor.

When using Android Studio, click **Sync Project with Gradle Files** in the upper right corner, the program will automatically load the FTC SDK libraries that the folder needs to use, it will take some time, please be patient.
